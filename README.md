# Drowsiness-Detection



                 Car accident is the major cause of death in which around 1.3 million people die every year. Majority of these accidents are caused because of distraction or the drowsiness of driver. Construction of high-speed highway roads had diminished the margin of error for the driver. The countless number of people drives for long distance every day and night on the highway. Lack of sleep or distractions like the phone call, talking with the passenger, etc may lead to an accident. To prevent such accidents we propose a system which alerts the driver if the driver gets distracted or feels drowsy. Facial landmarks detection is used with help of image processing of images of the face captured using the camera, for detection of distraction or drowsiness.
